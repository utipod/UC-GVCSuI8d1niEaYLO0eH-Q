This program is designed for time under tension. We aren't going to count reps. I want you to focus on doing only clean full range of motion movements in the allotted time. It does not matter if you do 1 or 50, as long as they are clean. Rest time will be the time it takes to change the height of the rings. For Week 1 you will do 3 sets. Complete the routine twice. You will have two minute rest in between sets. If you want Week 2,3 &amp; 4 then kindly shoot me an e-mail at: n3vr3la@gmail.com and I'll be glad to send you the rest of the
program! 

I also forgot to add the importance of the False Grip on the Rings is due to the Rings not being a stationary tool. 
They can move 360 degrees. This makes the transition very difficult to obtain if you're not in a False Grip.
When you are in the False Grip, your palm is already on top of the ring, making the transition a lot smoother and soother
on the wrists. 



Tracklist:
1. Not for Nothing - Otis Mcdonald
2. Here (Lucian Remix) - Alessia Cara
3. I'd Love to Change the World (Matsubs Remix) - JETTA
4. Android Porn - Kraddy
5. Machi - Borgeous &amp; Ryos</description>
