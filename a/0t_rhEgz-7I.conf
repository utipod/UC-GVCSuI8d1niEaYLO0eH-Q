We aren't going to count reps. I want you to focus on doing only clean full range of motion movements in the allotted time. It does not matter if you do 1 or 50, as long as they are clean. Rest time will be the time it takes to change the height of the rings. For Week 1 you will do 3 sets. Complete the routine twice. You will have two minute rest in between sets. If you want Week 2,3 & 4 then kindly shoot me an e-mail at: n3vr3la@gmail.com and I'll be glad to send you the rest of the\nprogram! \n\nI also forgot to add the importance of the False Grip on the Rings is due to the Rings not being a stationary tool. \nThey can move 360 degrees. This makes the transition very difficult to obtain if you're not in a False Grip.\nWhen you are in the False Grip, your palm is already on top of the ring, making the transition a lot smoother and soother\non the wrists. \n\n\n\nTracklist:\n1. Not for Nothing - Otis Mcdonald\n2. Here (Lucian Remix) - Alessia Cara\n3. I'd Love to Change the World (Matsubs Remix) - JETTA\n4. Android Porn - Kraddy\n5. Machi - Borgeous & Ryos"
